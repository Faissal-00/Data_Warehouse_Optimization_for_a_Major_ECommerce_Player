The created indexes on the FactOrder, FactInventory, and DIMProductSupplier tables serve to optimize query performance in specific scenarios. For instance, they enable faster retrieval of orders by customer, product, shipping method, status, and date, improving efficiency in customer and order-related operations. Similarly, indexes on inventory-related columns enhance the speed of inventory queries, especially concerning unique inventory IDs, warehouse associations, and restock dates. Lastly, indexes on product and supplier IDs expedite searches involving product-supplier relationships, streamlining supplier and product-related tasks. These indexes collectively enhance database responsiveness and application performance.
